=== Introduction

The Code-First approach is useful mainly in Domain Driven Design. In the Code-First approach, you focus on the domain
of your application and start creating classes for your domain entity rather than creating your database (DB-First) or creating your API (Design-First) first.
And only after you can create domain classes, a DB structure and an appropriate API specification will be created.

With regards to creating API specification, it means that the specification can be automatically generated from the class sources.
This generation has to use a classes meta information that can be provided using annotations, for example.

Agrest provides the following annotations:

`@AgAttribute`

`@AgId`

`@AgRelationship`

`@AgResource`

If you specify your models and resources using these annotations, the Agrest Maven plugin will generate
an API specification in the openapi v.3.0 format.
