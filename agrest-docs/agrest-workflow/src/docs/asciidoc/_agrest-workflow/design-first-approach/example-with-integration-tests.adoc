=== More examples with integration tests

Agrest has more https://github.com/agrestio/agrest/tree/master/agrest-openapi-designfirst-test[Examples]
of Design-First approach implementation that are provided as separate module with set of tests.
To run it use `mvn clean install` command.
The API description (contract) is defined in file `src/test/java/resources/api.yaml`.

All generated APIs will be located on `src/test/java` together with corresponding integration tests.

During the build time the API implementation is generated by Maven plugin and then this implementation is checked by integration tests.
We use testing fixtures from https://github.com/agrestio/agrest/tree/master/agrest[agrest] module as models.
