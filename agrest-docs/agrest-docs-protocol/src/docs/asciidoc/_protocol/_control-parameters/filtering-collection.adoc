=== Filtering Collection with `exp`

A conditional expression that is used to filter the response objects. Expression
String should follow the
http://cayenne.apache.org/docs/4.0/cayenne-guide/expressions.html[format understood by Cayenne].
The root for the property paths is the request entity
(unless "exp" is used within a relationship "include", in which case the root is that related entity).

Example 1: Filtering on a single property.

`exp=vhost='agrest.io'`


Example 2: Filtering using outer join (the "+" sign is Cayenne notation for outer).

`exp=articles+ = null`


Example 3: Filtering with parameters using positional bindings.

`exp=["articles.body like $b","%Agrest%"]`


Example 4: Filtering with parameters using named bindings.

`exp={ "exp" : "articles.body like $b", "params":{"b":"%Agrest%"}}`
