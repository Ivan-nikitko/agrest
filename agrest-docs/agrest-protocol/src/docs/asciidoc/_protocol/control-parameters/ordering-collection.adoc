=== Ordering Collection with `sort / dir`

Example 1: Sort on a single property.

`sort=vhost`

Example 2: Sort descending on a property.

`sort=id&amp;dir=DESC`

Example 3: Same as 2, but sort is a JSON object.

`sort={"property":"vhost","direction":"DESC"}`

Example 4: Multiple sortings as a single JSON structure.

`sort=[{"property":"name"},"property":"vhost","direction":"DESC"}]`
