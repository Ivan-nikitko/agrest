=== Defining the API

Agrest provides the `AgServerCodegen` class and a set of custom Mustache templates to generate an API implementation
based on `OpenAPI 3.0` specification.

The top-down workflow for creating the API is as follows:

==== 1. Start with domain models
Create a `bookstore-api.yaml` file to define your API and put it in the `src/main/java/resources` folder.
Add general information regarding your API:
[source, yaml]
----
openapi: 3.0.0
servers:
  - url: 'http://127.0.0.1/v1'
info:
  title: Agrest-based API of Bookstore
  description: An API for interacting with the Bookstore backend server
  version: v1
----

Then add definition of your models.
If you want to create an updated API (e.g. POST, PUT) of your model, you have to define a 'requestBodies' element
in addition to a 'schemas' element.

Please make sure that you can either specify existing Java-DB mapping classes
(based on `CayenneDataObject` e.g. our `Category` and `Book`) or generate simple POJO models  by Maven plugin.

For further information, please refer to <<Configure and run API generation>> section.

But in either case you have to define models in the `.yaml` file:

[source, yaml]
----
tags:
  - name: Category
    description: |
      This model represents a Category type and is used to retrieve, create and update a book Category information.

components:
  schemas:
    Category:
      type: object
      properties:
       id:
         type: string
         description: Unique ID of Category
         example: 1
       name:
         type: string
         description: Book Category name
         example: Science Fiction
       description:
         type: string
         description: Description of Category
         example: Science fiction (often shortened to Sci-Fi or SF) is a genre of speculative fiction.

  requestBodies:
    Category:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            $ref: '#/components/schemas/Category'
      description: Category object that needs to be created or updated
      required: true
----


==== 2. Attach Agrest protocol definition
The Agrest protocol file <<protocol>> contains definition of all <<protocol#control-parameters, Control Parameters>>.
Just place this `protocol.yaml` in the catalog were your main `bookstore-api.yaml` file is located (e.g. 'src/main/java/resources').

==== 3. Define resources
Add REST API resource definition to your `bookstore-api.yaml` file.
Make sure that Agrest protocol parameters are defined as references.

[source, yaml]

  /category:
    get:
      summary: Get list of all Book Categories

      tags:
        - Category
      parameters:
        - $ref: '../resources/protocol.yaml#/components/queryParams/Limit'
        - $ref: '../resources/protocol.yaml#/components/queryParams/Start'

    get:

      operationId: getOne
      tags:
        - Category
      parameters:
        - name: id
          in: path
          description: ID of Category to fetch
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
            format: int32
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Success responce
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Category'
          description: Unexpected error

==== 4. Run build-time API generation
To generate an Agrest-based API, a special Maven plugin is used.
This plugin should be configured in accordance with your `.yaml` files location
<<inputSpec>>, packages <<apiPackage>>, output catalog <<output>>, etc.

`mvn clean install` runs generation of the API.
